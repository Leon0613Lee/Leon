The story revolves around Shu Ouma, a high school boy who inadvertently obtains an ability called "Power of the King" that enables him to draw out items called "Voids" from other people. He is then thrown into the conflict between a quasi-governmental organization known as the GHQ and a resistance organization called Funeral Parlor which aims to restore Japan's independence from the GHQ. In the process, Shu has to deal with the burden his ability puts on his shoulders and the horrific mystery of his past. The series incorporates elements of numerous genres, mostly drawing from science fantasy.<br>
            Two manga adaptations were published by ASCII Media Works and Square Enix. A light novel was published by Nitroplus titled Guilty Crown: Princess of Deadpool in April 2012. A spin-off visual novel named Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas was also developed by Nitroplus which came bundled with a 15-minute original video animation (OVA) named Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas.<br>
            The series has received polarized critical reaction, with praise going to the series' music and artwork and criticism going to the plot for being jumbled and cliché. Some character developments have been well received and the series' second half has been praised for its setting.</p></td>
